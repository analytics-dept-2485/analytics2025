## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Next, set up the database on Vercel with test data.
```sql

CREATE TABLE phr2025 (
   ID serial PRIMARY KEY,
   ScoutName VARCHAR (255),
   ScoutTeam INT,
   Team INT,

```

Next, set up the .env.local by copying and renaming .env.local.template to .env.local.
Import your database passwords from vercel to your local machine in that file.
Add the database name yourself.
Add the FIRST api token.

Finally, execute the following command to run the code:

```bash
npm run dev
```
